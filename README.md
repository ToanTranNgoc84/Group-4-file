Overview
Welcome to the Data Wrangling Quest! Your mission: to clean a messy data set known as “Shark Attacks” through using data wrangling techniques. By doing so you will be able to prepare the data set for analysis for a use case of your choice. During this quest, you’ll advance your Python skills, take the next steps to becoming a data analyst, enhance teamwork, and develop your problem-solving skills.

Quest Brief
You will initially examine the Shark Attack dataset, understanding its structure and formulating a hypothesis or several hypotheses about the data. For example, you might hypothesize that shark attacks are more common in certain geographical locations, or among individuals engaging in particular activities.

If you want to go further, you could even define a Business Case, such as “As a company that sells diving trips, I want to suggest destination for shark spotting”, or “ As a company that sells surf experiences or surf boards, I want to know where to set up a new shop and avoid shark attacks”.

Throughout the project, you’ll utilize Python programming and the pandas library to implement at least five data cleaning techniques to handle issues such as missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. Once the dataset is cleaned, you’ll use basic exploratory data analysis to validate your initial hypotheses and extract meaningful insights.

The Presentation
You will present your quest on Friday morning to the class showcasing how your game works as well as a short presentation in the form of some slides. You should present your findings to the class in a visually appealing, easily understandable manner. The format of the presentation will be as follows:

Talking with Slides: 3 minutes
Demo: 2 minutes
Total: 5 minutes
